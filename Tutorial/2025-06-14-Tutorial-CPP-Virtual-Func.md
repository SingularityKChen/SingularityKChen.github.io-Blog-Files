# TL;DR

- **Virtual Functions** enable runtime polymorphism, allowing derived classes to override base class behavior.
- **Pure Virtual Functions** define interfaces; derived classes must implement them.
- **Abstract Classes** cannot be instantiated; they contain at least one pure virtual function.
- **Design Patterns** like Strategy, Factory, and Template Method rely on virtual and pure virtual functions for flexible system design.

# 1. Virtual Functions: The Core of Runtime Polymorphism

## 1.1 What Are Virtual Functions?

A **virtual function** is a member function in a base class that you expect to override in derived classes. It enables **runtime polymorphism**, where the function called is determined by the object‚Äôs type at runtime, not the pointer/reference type. This mechanism allows for **dynamic dispatch**, a cornerstone of object-oriented design.

## 1.2 When to Use Virtual Functions

| Scenario | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Runtime Polymorphism** | Call derived class methods via base class pointers/references. |
| **Interface Definition** | Base class defines an interface for derived classes. |
| **Template Method Pattern** | Base class defines an algorithm skeleton with customizable steps. |
| **Virtual Destructors** | Prevent memory leaks when deleting derived objects via base pointers. |

## 1.3 How Virtual Functions Work Under the Hood

Virtual functions rely on a **virtual table (vtable)** and **virtual pointer (vptr)** mechanism:
- **vtable**: A hidden static array of function pointers associated with a class. Each entry points to a virtual function.
- **vptr**: A hidden pointer in each object that points to its class‚Äôs vtable.

### Example:
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void foo() { std::cout << "Base::foo\n"; }
    virtual ~Base() = default;
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void foo() override { 
        std::cout << "Derived::foo\n"; 
    }
};

int main() {
    Derived d;
    Base* b = &d;
    b->foo(); // Output: Derived::foo
}
```

- At runtime, `b->foo()` resolves to `Derived::foo` via the vtable.
- The compiler ensures the vptr points to the correct vtable for the object‚Äôs actual type.

> **Key Insight**: Virtual functions introduce indirection (via vtable), which adds runtime overhead but enables flexible polymorphic behavior.

# 2. Pure Virtual Functions and Abstract Classes

## 2.1 What Is a Pure Virtual Function?

A **pure virtual function** is a virtual function declared with `= 0` in the base class, indicating that it has **no default implementation**. It serves as a placeholder for behavior that derived classes **must** implement.

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void foo() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};
```

- **Abstract Class Requirement**: A class containing at least one pure virtual function becomes an **abstract class** and cannot be instantiated.
- **Derived Class Obligation**: Any concrete (non-abstract) derived class **must override** all pure virtual functions.

## 2.2 Abstract Classes: Design and Behavior

An **abstract class** acts as a blueprint for derived classes. It can contain:
- **Pure virtual functions** (mandatory overrides)
- **Concrete virtual functions** (optional overrides)
- **Non-virtual functions** (inherited as-is)

### Example: Intermediate Abstract Class
If you want to create an intermediate class like `test_base_class` that does **not** implement the pure virtual functions from `base_class`, you can simply inherit without overriding:
```cpp
class base_class {
public:
    virtual void do_something() = 0; // Pure virtual
    virtual ~base_class() = default;
};

class test_base_class : public base_class {
    // No override ‚Üí still abstract
};
```

> ‚úÖ **Key Insight**: You are **not required** to explicitly redeclare pure virtual functions in `test_base_class`. The inheritance is implicit. However, **explicitly declaring them** (e.g., `virtual void do_something() override = 0;`) improves readability and makes the abstract nature of the class more obvious.

## 2.3 Default Implementations for Pure Virtual Functions

Although rare, **pure virtual functions can have default implementations**. This allows derived classes to **reuse** the base implementation if desired.

### Example:
```cpp
class base_class {
public:
    virtual void do_something() = 0; // Pure virtual declaration
    virtual ~base_class() = default;
};

// Default implementation
void base_class::do_something() {
    std::cout << "Default implementation\n";
}

class Derived : public base_class {
public:
    void do_something() override {
        base_class::do_something(); // Call default behavior
        std::cout << "Derived extension\n";
    }
};
```

> üìå **Important**: Even with a default implementation, the class remains abstract because of the `= 0` in the declaration.

## 2.4 Pure Virtual Destructors

A pure virtual destructor is special. While you can declare it as pure, you **must provide a default implementation**, or your program will fail to link.

### Example:
```cpp
class base_class {
public:
    virtual ~base_class() = 0; // Pure virtual destructor
};

// Required implementation
base_class::~base_class() {
    // Cleanup common to all derived classes
}
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Rule**: A pure virtual destructor ensures derived classes must define their own destructors, but the base class still needs an implementation to allow proper destruction during object lifetime.

# 3. Design Patterns Using Virtual and Pure Virtual Functions

## 3.1 Strategy Pattern: Dynamic Behavior Switching

**Problem**:  
You want to define a family of algorithms (e.g., payment methods), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable at runtime without modifying the context that uses them.

**Solution**:  
Use the **Strategy Pattern** with an abstract class (`PaymentStrategy`) defining a common interface. Concrete strategies (`CreditCard`, `PayPal`) implement specific behaviors.

### Example:
```cpp
// Abstract strategy interface
class PaymentStrategy {
public:
    virtual void pay(int amount) = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual ~PaymentStrategy() = default;
};

// Concrete strategy 1
class CreditCard : public PaymentStrategy {
public:
    void pay(int amount) override {
        std::cout << "Paid $" << amount << " by Credit Card\n";
    }
};

// Concrete strategy 2
class PayPal : public PaymentStrategy {
public:
    void pay(int amount) override {
        std::cout << "Paid $" << amount << " via PayPal\n";
    }
};

// Context using the strategy
class ShoppingCart {
public:
    void setPaymentStrategy(PaymentStrategy* strategy) {
        this->strategy = strategy;
    }

    void checkout(int totalAmount) {
        if (strategy) {
            strategy->pay(totalAmount);
        } else {
            std::cout << "No payment method selected.\n";
        }
    }

private:
    PaymentStrategy* strategy = nullptr;
};
```

### Usage:
```cpp
int main() {
    ShoppingCart cart;
    
    CreditCard cc;
    PayPal pp;

    cart.setPaymentStrategy(&cc);
    cart.checkout(100); // Output: Paid $100 by Credit Card

    cart.setPaymentStrategy(&pp);
    cart.checkout(200); // Output: Paid $200 via PayPal
}
```

**Key Advantages**:
- **Flexibility**: Add new payment methods without changing `ShoppingCart`.
- **Avoids Conditionals**: No need for `if/else` or `switch` statements.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Payment logic is decoupled from business logic.

**Real-World Use Cases**:
- Payment gateways in e-commerce.
- Sorting/searching algorithms.
- Compression formats (e.g., ZIP, GZIP).

## 3.2 Factory Pattern: Centralized Object Creation

**Problem**:  
You want to encapsulate object creation logic, allowing subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. This promotes loose coupling between object users and their concrete types.

**Solution**:  
Use the **Factory Pattern** with an abstract class (`Product`) and a factory method that returns a base class pointer.

### Example:
```cpp
// Abstract product interface
class Product {
public:
    virtual std::string name() const = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual ~Product() = default;
};

// Concrete product 1
class Chair : public Product {
public:
    std::string name() const override {
        return "Chair";
    }
};

// Concrete product 2
class Table : public Product {
public:
    std::string name() const override {
        return "Table";
    }
};

// Factory class
class ProductFactory {
public:
    static Product* createProduct(const std::string& type) {
        if (type == "chair") {
            return new Chair();
        } else if (type == "table") {
            return new Table();
        } else {
            return nullptr;
        }
    }
};
```

### Usage:
```cpp
int main() {
    Product* p1 = ProductFactory::createProduct("chair");
    Product* p2 = ProductFactory::createProduct("table");

    if (p1) std::cout << "Created: " << p1->name() << "\n"; // Output: Created: Chair
    if (p2) std::cout << "Created: " << p2->name() << "\n"; // Output: Created: Table

    delete p1;
    delete p2;
}
```

**Key Advantages**:
- **Centralized Creation**: All object creation logic resides in one place.
- **Extensibility**: Add new product types without modifying existing code.
- **Decoupling**: Clients depend on the `Product` interface, not concrete types.

**Real-World Use Cases**:
- GUI toolkits (e.g., `createButton()`, `createWindow()`).
- Database connection factories (MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Game entity spawning systems.

## 3.3 Interface Abstraction: Enforcing Contracts

**Problem**:  
You need to define a standardized API that multiple implementations must follow, ensuring consistency across different modules or plugins.

**Solution**:  
Use an **abstract class with pure virtual functions** to define an interface (`ILogger`). Derived classes (`ConsoleLogger`, `FileLogger`) must implement the required methods.

### Example:
```cpp
// Abstract interface
class ILogger {
public:
    virtual void log(const std::string& message) = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual ~ILogger() = default;
};

// Concrete implementation 1
class ConsoleLogger : public ILogger {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) override {
        std::cout << "[Console] " << message << "\n";
    }
};

// Concrete implementation 2
class FileLogger : public ILogger {
public:
    void log(const std::string& message) override {
        std::ofstream file("app.log", std::ios::app);
        file << "[File] " << message << "\n";
    }
};
```

### Usage:
```cpp
void logMessage(ILogger* logger, const std::string& msg) {
    logger->log(msg); // Polymorphic dispatch
}

int main() {
    ConsoleLogger console;
    FileLogger file;

    logMessage(&console, "User logged in");  // Output: [Console] User logged in
    logMessage(&file, "System error");      // Output: [File] System error in app.log
}
```

**Key Advantages**:
- **Contract Enforcement**: Ensures all loggers implement `log()`.
- **Plug-and-Play**: Swap logging implementations without code changes.
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions.

**Real-World Use Cases**:
- Logging frameworks (e.g., log4cpp).
- Cross-platform APIs (e.g., `IFileSystem` for Windows/Linux/Mac).
- Plugin architectures (e.g., IDE extensions).

# 4. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

## 4.1 Virtual Destructors

- If a base class is intended for inheritance, its destructor **must be virtual**.
- For pure virtual destructors, always provide a default implementation.

## 4.2 Function Signature Consistency

- Overriding a virtual function requires **exact signature matching**, including `const` qualifiers and parameter lists.
- Use `override` to ensure correct overrides and `final` to prevent further overrides.

## 4.3 Avoid Unnecessary Virtual Functions

- Use virtual functions only when runtime polymorphism is needed.
- For compile-time polymorphism, prefer templates or CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern).

## 4.4 Performance Considerations

- Virtual functions introduce indirection (via vtable), which adds runtime overhead.
- Avoid virtual functions in performance-critical code (e.g., hot paths, embedded systems).

## 4.5 Inline and Header-Only Definitions

- If you define a pure virtual function with a default implementation and mark it `inline`, ensure it's placed in a header file.
